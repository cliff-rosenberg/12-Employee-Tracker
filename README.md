## Description

  This is a "command line" style application that allows a business owner to manage the employees and their roles for a small company. The text menus presented allow the user to perform multiple functions on the data:
  
*   Viewing all Department names
*   Viewing all Employees in the company database (showing ID number, First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Department, Salary, and that employee's manager name, if applicable)
*   Viewing all employee Roles
*   Adding a new Department name to Company
*   Adding a new Role to be assigned to Employees
*   Adding new Employees to Company (adding First Name, Last Name, the Role from a list, and a Manager from the Company managers in the database)
*   Updating the Role assigned to an employee

A simple main menu allows the user to choose form these functions, which produces a formatted output for "View" tasks, and input functions for adding/updating tasks.
